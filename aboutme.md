Hello! My name is Ridley and was born and raised in Atlanta but currently living/working in San Francisco. I've been known to skip the small talk and ask questions as if I've known you for years. I love the little things in life and don't take one day for granted. 

### How my past managers would describe me
- Impressionable
- Data driven
- Relentlessly positive
- Curious


### Typical questions my friends ask me 
- "Hey, can you help me pull this data?"
- "Do you have any good questions I can ask during my upcoming interview?"
- "Are you really staying in again tonight?"

### Fun Facts

- [Tan France](https://www.tanfrance.com/) is my style icon
- [Daniel Ceasar's NPR Tiny Desk concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBKa-AAy_vo) is the only thing you need in your life.
